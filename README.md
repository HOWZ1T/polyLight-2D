# polyLight-2D
Polylight2D is a 2d light simulator, it uses raycasting to create polygons which forms the shape of the shadow. This is much more efficient and effective than my last light simulator!

# Controls:
-Left click and drag the mouse and then release to create a rectangular solid object
-Hover over a rectangle with the mouse and press 'x' to delete the solid object
-Hover over the light source (the blue circle) and hold right click to move, release right click to stop moving the light source.
-Press 'r' to toggle the rays on or off
-Press 's' to toggle the shadows on or off
